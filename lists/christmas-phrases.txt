A time for giving
A time for joy
All is calm, all is bright
Angels we have heard on high
Baking gingerbread
Bells are ringing
Boughs of holly
Bundled up in scarves
Candles glowing bright
Candles in the window
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Cozy fireside chats
Dashing through the snow
Dazzling holiday lights
Deck the halls
Dreaming of a white Christmas
Eggnog and gingerbread
Eggnog sipping
Elf on a shelf
Elves at the North Pole
Festive cheer
Frosty the Snowman
Frosty windowpanes
Garland of lights
Gifts of love
Glittering ornaments
Good tidings we bring
Hark the herald angels sing
Ho, ho, ho!
Holiday traditions
Holly jolly season
Home for the holidays
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
I'll be home for Christmas
Icicles glistening
Icicles hanging from the eaves
Icy window scene
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells ringing
Jolly old St. Nicholas
Keeping warm by the fire
Kindness and goodwill
Krampus-free zone
Kris Kringle's visit
Let it snow
Little drummer boy
Love and laughter
Merry and bright
Mistletoe kisses
Noel and joy
Noel melodies
Nostalgic yuletide
Nutcracker ballet
O Christmas Tree
O come, all ye faithful
Oh what fun!
Oh, holy night
Opening presents under the tree
Peace and goodwill to all
Peace on Earth
Poinsettias in bloom
Presents under the tree
Quiet moments by the fire
Quiet snowfall
Radiant star atop the tree
Red and green decorations
Reindeer on the roof
Reindeer sleigh bells
Silent night
Sleigh bells ringing
Snowflakes dancing
Snowflakes falling
Tidings of comfort and joy
Tinsel and glitter
Tis the season
Togetherness and joy
Twas the night before Christmas
Twinkling lights
Ugly Christmas sweaters
Underneath the mistletoe
Unwrapping gifts with glee
Uplifting carolers
Velvet bows and ribbons
Very merry Christmas
Warm winter wishes
Whispers of Christmas magic
Winter wonderland
Xmas cookies baking
Xmas magic
XOXO, Merry Christmas!
Yuletide greetings
